# Sentiment Analysis Vers.2
This tool will take a csv of reviews with the column heading as "text"
It will then decide the sentiment of the reviews with a low amount of textual knowledge, defined in word_sentiments.
As it is, it will be able to work out reviews with perfect english, and a well structured, straight-forward review. 

# The Flaws
This tool does not know what the context of the review is based on. The need for a new version comes from a review that recommends another book, in which the reviewer begins to give positive feedback for that book, confusing the script.

To get a higher accuracy, I will try to implement machine learning to root out these new issues.
